Vim--Monokai-Terminal
=====================

Terminal Color Palette for Monokai Theme

Cater for CLI dogmatists and Monokai Aficionado by Omnipotent Terminals!

Jokes. This is a Vim Terminal configuration with Suboptimal Monokai color.
Most terminal color schemes use 256 colors. Here a 16 color version is presented.
You need reset your color palette. Your terminal palette:

Text : #F8F8F2

232526 | EF5939 | FD971F | E6DB74 | 70F0F0 | BCA3A3 | 960050 | 465457
808080 | F92672 | A6E22E | C4BE89 | 66D9EF | AE81FF | 7070F0 | F8F8F0

this configuration balances between monokai palette and monokai palette.

Eleven main color in monokai and 5 ancilliary color for normal terminal usage.
If you don't want to change your terminal color, or you like to use 256 terminal, there already exist monokai themes on github.

What's more, to make italic fonts work, add following into your vimrc:
set t_ZH=[3m
where ^ stands for ctrl+v, and the first [ stands for esc
the second [ is a plain left square bracket
